## Complete System Overview

### Total API Surface
- **30+ Endpoints** across 14 functional areas
- **Complete CRUD** operations for all major entities

- **Capacity limits**: Real-time enrollment checking

### Error Handling Standards
All endpoints follow consistent patterns:
- **400**: Validation errors with detailed field-level messages
